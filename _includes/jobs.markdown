# Job Posting, __Stage N Software__

### Join us to help build _Unison_, a revolutionary new platform for software development

[Unison](http://unisonweb.org) is a new, open programming platform being designed and implemented from the ground up to be 10-100x more productive than any programming tech in widespread use. [Read more about it here](http://unisonweb.org/2015-05-07/about.html).

Starting ASAP, we (Stage N Software) will be building out the technology, looking for initial markets in which to apply it, seeking feedback and evangelizing the tech with developers, and raising money. The platform is and will remain open source and freely available, but if successful, we plan to earn revenue selling managed cloud services and other products built atop the platform, for which there would be enormous markets. Our overall mission: _transform civilization for the better by radically advancing our ability to create and use software_.

If you are passionate about bringing better software technology to the world and are interested in partnering with us, we are in need of a __Principal Software Developer and Chief Evangelist__. In this role you'll help design and implement all aspects of the Unison platform, grow and nurture the open source community around Unison, seek feedback from developers of all skill levels and backgrounds, and evangelize the platform via presentations at local meetups and conferences, blogging, and social media. Desired skills: deep experience with at least one statically-typed functional language (such as Haskell, OCaml, or purely functional Scala), excellent communication skills, fearless learning ability, strong self-motivation and focus, and high emotional intelligence. 

Those interested in the project but with less experience are still encouraged to apply for the role of __Software Developer__. At least some experience in statically typed FP and an ability to learn quickly are necessary for this role, since you'll be writing Haskell code to implement all aspects of the Unison platform.

## Benefits to joining

At Stage N, you'll get to work on new, highly advanced software, [written in Haskell](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison), bringing together some of the best ideas, research, and engineering practice. You'll build quality software designed for the future rather than hacked together to solve short-term needs. And because of the foundational nature of this project, you'll need to develop deep understandings of many different areas of computing: compilers, type theory, distributed systems, database technologies, language runtimes, functional-reactive programming, and more. Unlike most programming jobs, you'll be involved in actually _building_ ground-up rethinks of many of these computing technologies we now take for granted.

Besides being technically interesting, your work on Unison can have a huge impact on the software industry and well beyond.

## Compensation

Compensation is highly negotiable. We can offer a mixture of:

* A competitive hourly rate based on working 1-3 days per week at Stage N Consulting, the consulting arm of Stage N Software, specializing in consulting related to purely functional programming in Scala and Haskell. Your experience level and client availability will determine the rate, but it's quite possible to make a reasonable income just from part-time consulting. 
* A salary, also contingent on working 1-3 days per week at Stage N Consulting. 
* Equity in Stage N Software. This is negotiable, but generally, the more time devoted to work on Unison (as opposed to the consulting), the more equity you can expect, since you'll be taking on more risk.

Note that this is a very early stage startup with no substantive funding other than consulting revenue. Though our goal is to secure funding by end of 2016, there are obviously no guarantees of that.

## Details

We are open to considering candidates living just about anywhere, but in the event you live outside the Boston area, you should be willing and able to travel to Boston semi-regularly for in-person collaboration. Being somewhat close in time zone to Boston or being willing to work a shifted schedule is also a plus.

__How to apply:__

Send an email to Paul Chiusano at paul.chiusano@stage-n.com, and let us know:

* Why you are interested in the project
* Where you are based, and what is your ability to travel occasionally or relocate to Boston, at least for a 3-6 month period during 2016
* When you are available to start
* A sense of your background and experience, particularly in the areas we are looking for
* Any questions you have

## Who's involved

Paul Chiusano is the founder of Stage N Software, Stage N Consulting, and is the Unison platform creator and technical lead. He's also co-author of the book [Functional Programming in Scala][], has been writing Haskell and Scala code for 7+ years, and has a deep passion for building better tools for software development.

Though most initial work on Unison has been done by Paul in between paid consulting work, a number of people have been and continue to be involved in aspects of Unison's design, implementation, and architecture. We mention just a few people:

* Dan Doel has worked on various aspects of the Unison typechecker, aided in architecture and design work, and helped design and implement Unison's novel hashing scheme. Dan has over 10 years experience with functional programming (including both Haskell and Scala), with a specialization in type theory and compiler implementation.
* Josh Cough has provided design feedback and helped with the implementation of the Unison distributed programming API. Josh has been writing Scala and Haskell code for many years.   
* Edward Kmett has done consulting on various aspects of the Unison core libraries, notably the Unison persistent data API and its implementation database tech. Edward is a worldwide expert in Haskell and FP, a regular speaker and presenter, and author of many widely-used open source Haskell libraries.

The open source project has also seen some activity and outside contributions, which we hope will develop further as the platform gets further along.
